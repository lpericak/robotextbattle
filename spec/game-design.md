# Robot Battle — Game Design

## Overview

A turn-based robot combat game played in the browser. Players name their
robot, buy weapons and gear from a shop, then fight increasingly tough
enemies to earn money and experience. Built for kids — simple mechanics,
fun descriptions, clear feedback.

## Core Loop

1. **Name** your robot (you start with a free Stick)
2. **Shop** — buy weapons, gear, consumables; sell unwanted items
3. **Fight** — pick an enemy, choose actions each turn, win or lose
4. **Level up** — earn XP from wins, unlock higher-tier items and enemies
5. Repeat from step 2

## Combat

- **Simultaneous turns**: both player and enemy choose actions, then
  actions resolve in random order
- **Actions**: Attack (pick weapons), Use Item (consumable), Rest (+5 energy)
- **Hit chance**: `(accuracy - dodge) / 100`, clamped to 0–1
- **Damage**: `floor(baseDamage * (1 + attackPercent/100)) - defence`, min 0
- **HP clamping**: HP never displays below 0 in battle summaries/snapshots
- **Hands**: each weapon costs hands; total cannot exceed available hands
- **Energy**: attacks cost energy; resting restores 5
- **Consumables**: single-use, apply effects immediately (before turn resolution)
- **Victory**: reduce enemy HP to 0; rewards money + XP
- **Defeat**: robot is "destroyed" but auto-rebuilt; earns $10 consolation
- **Surrender**: forfeit mid-battle; earns $10 consolation (same as defeat)
- **Auto-Battle**: AI plays for you with a 250ms pause between turns
- **Fight Again**: after any battle result, a "Fight Again" button
  re-enters battle against the same opponent immediately (skipping
  the menu → fight → select → detail flow)
- **Defeated badges**: the fight menu shows a white ✔ on enemies
  you've beaten, and a yellow ★ if beaten on challenge mode
- **Challenge mode bonus**: first-time challenge mode win against
  an enemy pays double money (same XP)

## Auto-Battle

An action in the battle menu labeled "Auto". When selected, the AI
takes over the player's decisions for the remainder of the fight. Each
turn plays out automatically with accelerating speed.

### Behavior

- Appears in the battle action menu alongside Attack, Use Item, Rest,
  Surrender
- Once activated, the battle runs to completion without player input
- Uses `aiPlanAction(battle, true)` — the same AI logic already used
  for enemy turns and for the default-move suggestions
- Each auto-turn: clear screen → show battle status + turn log → delay →
  next turn
- Delay starts at 250ms and decreases by 5ms per turn (min 150ms)
- Battle ends normally (victory or defeat) — no surrender during auto
- After the battle ends, the normal rewards/defeat screen is shown and
  the player presses Enter to continue (same as manual battle)

### Why a battle action (not a toggle elsewhere)

The choice appears mid-battle because that's when tedium strikes. A
kid starts a fight, does a few turns manually, gets bored, hits
Auto-Battle, and watches the rest play out. No settings screen needed.

## Game Modes

When starting a new game, the player chooses Normal or Sandbox mode.
Mode is permanent per save slot and cannot be changed.

### Normal Mode
Standard gameplay. Earn money from fights, buy items and upgrades with
money, level up to unlock higher-tier items. Defeated badges (check marks
and stars) are awarded for beating enemies.

### Sandbox Mode
Everything is free — items and upgrades cost $0, no level requirements
in the shop. No level cap (can level past 50). However, defeated badges
are not awarded (no check marks or stars). For kids who want to
experiment with every weapon and fight every enemy without grinding.

## Progression

- XP to level up: `10 + 2*(level-1)` — starts at 10, grows by 2 per level
- Level cap: 50 (XP stops accumulating once reached)
- Higher levels unlock better items in the shop and tougher enemies
- Money earned from wins; bonus from "Money Maker" gear
- Losses and surrenders earn $10 consolation money (you always make progress)

### Level-up unlock preview

After a fight, the rewards screen shows what the next level unlocks:
"Next level: Sword, Wooden Armor, Third Arm" (items at the next level).
This gives kids a visible goal to grind toward. If the player is already
at the max level with all items unlocked, this line is omitted.

## Items

### Weapons
| Name | Level | Damage | Energy | Accuracy | Hands | Cost |
|------|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|------|
| Stick | 0 | 1 | 1 | 80 | 1 | $50 |
| Wrench | 0 | 2 | 2 | 90 | 1 | $75 |
| Sword | 2 | 5 | 5 | 100 | 2 | $150 |
| Shock Rod | 3 | 5 | 3 | 95 | 1 | $200 |
| Sawed-off Shotgun | 5 | 15 | 0 | 150 | 1 | $300 |
| Flame Thrower | 5 | 10 | 0 | 90 | 2 | $150 |
| Lightsabre | 10 | 30 | 20 | 90 | 2 | $1000 |

Wrench is the early-game upgrade from Stick — double damage, better
accuracy, but costs more energy. Available from level 0 so a new
player can buy it after one MiniBot win.

### Gear
Passive stat bonuses. Does not stack (one of each type).

### Consumables
Single-use items: Repair Kit (+10 HP), Grenade (30 dmg), Throwing Net (-30 dodge).

## Starting Equipment

New players receive a free Stick in their inventory. This ensures
the first fight is winnable without visiting the shop. The Stick
is added during `createPlayer`, not as a shop purchase.

## Enemies

| Name | Level | Weapons | Gear | Reward | XP |
|------|-------|---------|------|--------|----|
| MiniBot | 1 | Stick | Cardboard Armor | $50 | 2 |
| Buzzblade | 2 | Wrench | Cardboard Armor, Propeller | $75 | 2 |
| Sparky | 3 | Shock Rod | Cardboard Armor, Small Battery, Small Computer Chip | $80 | 3 |
| Rustclaw | 4 | Wrench x2 | Cardboard Armor, Third Arm, Propeller | $120 | 4 |
| Firebot | 5 | Flame Thrower | Wooden Armor, Gold Computer Chip | $150 | 5 |
| Voltank | 7 | Sawed-off Shotgun, Shock Rod | Wooden Armor, Medium Battery, Fourth Arm, Small Computer Chip, Shotgun Shell | $250 | 7 |
| Omega | 10 | Lightsabre | Big Battery, Gold Computer Chip, Power Chip | $500 | 10 |

MiniBot is the intro enemy — nerfed to only Cardboard Armor (no
Propeller) so a fresh player with a Stick can reliably win.

### Enemy select screen

The fight menu is a paginated list of enemies. Each enemy is a button
showing name, level, and a difficulty tag. Selecting an enemy goes to
an **enemy detail screen** (interstitial) before the fight starts.

#### Enemy list

Shows one button per enemy plus a Back button:
```
=== CHOOSE YOUR OPPONENT ===
Back
1. MiniBot (Lv1) [Fair]
2. Sparky (Lv3) [Hard]
3. Rustclaw (Lv4) [Hard]
4. Firebot (Lv5) [Deadly]
5. Voltank (Lv7) [Deadly]
6. Omega (Lv10) [Deadly]
```

Difficulty tags are based on enemy level vs player level:
- **Easy**: enemy level < player level
- **Fair**: enemy level = player level
- **Hard**: enemy level is 1-2 above player level
- **Deadly**: enemy level is 3+ above player level

This scales to any number of enemies — just buttons in a list.

#### Enemy detail screen (interstitial)

After clicking an enemy, a detail screen shows full info before
committing to the fight:

```
=== MiniBot ===
A shoebox sized cardboard box robot with a stick.

  HP: 15 | Dodge: 0 | Defence: 0
  Weapons: Stick (1 dmg)
  Reward: $50 | XP: 2

[Fight]  [Back]
```

This shows:
- Description (flavor text)
- Stats: HP, dodge, defence (computed from gear)
- Weapons: name + damage for each weapon the enemy carries
- Reward: money + XP

Two buttons: Fight (starts the battle) or Back (return to enemy list).

This design separates browsing from committing — kids can check out
any enemy without accidentally starting a fight, and the list stays
clean even with 20+ enemies.

## Save & Load

Game progress persists in browser `localStorage` under the key
`robot-battle-save`. Saving is fully automatic — the player never
needs to press a save button.

### When saves happen

- Immediately after creating a new robot (so the save always exists)
- After every fight (win, loss, or surrender — once back at main menu)
- After every shop session (when leaving the shop back to main menu)

### Title screen behavior

On launch, the game checks `localStorage` for an existing save:

- **No save found**: normal flow — title screen → "Name your robot" prompt
- **Save found**: title screen → two choices:
  - `Continue: <name> Lv.<level>` — loads the save and goes to main menu
  - `New Game` — deletes the save, prompts for a new name

### Quit behavior

Choosing "Quit" from the main menu does **not** end the game. It returns
to the title screen (New/Continue). The save persists. This lets kids
switch between starting fresh and continuing without reloading the page.

### What gets saved

The entire `Robot` object (name, level, exp, money, wins, fights,
inventory with all items). The `AssetRegistry` is **not** saved — it is
reloaded from JSON on every launch. Only the player's mutable state is
persisted.

### Storage format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "player": { /* Robot object */ }
}
```

The `version` field allows future migration if the save format changes.
If the version doesn't match, the save is discarded (treated as no save).

## Versioning

The game uses semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) tracked in `package.json`.
The version is the single source of truth — no separate version file.

### Display

The version is shown on the title screen below the game title:

```
=============================
       ROBOT BATTLE
=============================
v0.4.0

[Continue: Bolt Lv.3]  [New Game]
```

### When to bump

- **PATCH**: bug fixes, balance tweaks, new items/enemies
- **MINOR**: new features (e.g., new screen, new mechanic)
- **MAJOR**: breaking save format changes (save version also bumps)

### Cache busting

Vite content-hashes JS/CSS filenames automatically (`index-CjOT3fiV.js`).
The `index.html` file itself is not hashed — it relies on the serving
layer (nginx `no-cache` for staging, GCS default for prod). If stale
HTML becomes a problem, add `Cache-Control: no-cache` to the nginx
config for `/games/` paths.

## UI

Browser-based terminal aesthetic — green text on black background, monospace
font. Interactive via clickable choice buttons and text input. HP/energy
bars rendered with block characters.
